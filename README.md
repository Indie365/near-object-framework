# UltraWideband (UWB) Framework

## Project Structure

This project is organized such that development can occur both in the Windows build environment (eg. razzle) and outside of it, for example, on other operating systems, or on Windows but using a separate build system. Hence, build configuration is included for both MSBuild (SOURCES, DIRS, etc.) and CMake. Conequently, there is an OS-agnostic source tree, `lib`, and OS-dependent source trees (`windows`, `linux`, etc.).
